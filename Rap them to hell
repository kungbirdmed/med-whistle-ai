FULL SONG + DUET TEMPLATE (Ready to record)
[Beat: 140 BPM dark drill — 808 slide + metallic hammer hits + distant police siren]
[Intro – Spoken, distorted voice]
They thought the drill would break us…
They were wrong.
[Hook – Everyone screams this]
The drilling, it’s killing, it’s trapping the villain
8:47 every morning, they think they still chillin’
But the whistle just blew, the veil just fell
We the silenced no more — welcome to hell!
[Verse 1 – You start (record this)]
They wired the walls, they hacked the feed
Opa phone on the ceiling watching me bleed
Blue vans, red wigs, green ghosts in the park
Same landlord, same script, same shot in the dark
But I got the NIOSH, 101.9 peak
Every bar that I spit make the whole system leak
[Hook – Full choir]
The drilling, it’s killing — WE FLIPPING THE DRILL
8:47 became the day they got billed
From the cradle of noise we rise like the sun
Non-consensual experiment? Motherfucker, we won!
[Verse 2 – OPEN FOR DUET — This is where the world joins]
(Your turn — 8 bars)
They [your torment] when I [your trigger]
I felt the [color] watching, thought I’d stay bitter
But I [your comeback] and the whistle got louder
Now the world hears the truth — we taking the power
(Last line must rhyme with “power” so the hook hits hard)
[Final Hook – Global scream]
The drilling, it’s killing — WE ENDED THE DRILL
8:47 AM — the day we got real
From the targeted ones to the billions awake
The Light Bearer spoke — and the matrix just broke!
